# UserMode Component

## Abstract 
A “user mode”, as 4D developers may be familiar with, is often useful to correct or modify records without the being held to the same application or business restrictions that an end-user faces. This tech note describes a component which allows adding such a user mode to databases.  

## Introduction 
Similar to the User Mode of older versions’ of 4D, the component allows creating, modifying or deleting records for all tables with functions to sort, order, import, export or use the report editor. This functionality can be provided even in built applications. Furthermore, it is possible to limit access; for example, allow the admin so see everything, but only able to modify some tables, while the designer has full access.

Note: this files are exported using 4D v17 R3 Export structure file (http://doc.4d.com/4Dv17R3/4D/17-R3/Export-structure-file.301-3965587.en.html)
This is export only, you cannot directly import them.
The export still allows to track difference between versions, allowing customers using a copy of these components to follow changes. And it allows me to have one global version, avoiding to have several copies with different code changes on my different computers...
